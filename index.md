## Tracko

Tracko - the tracking tractor helps you keep track of your time.

### Privacy

The Tracko Browser Extension for Google Chrome allows you to track the time you spent on your Jira Issues.

To do so this extension requires you to authenticate yourself with your Atlassian Cloud Account. During this Process the Extension communcates directly with Atlassian, as well as with a simple Tracko Application hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The latter is solely being used for the authentication process and is necessary until Atlassian supports standalone applications. 
No user identifiable information is being stored during this process for any purpose.

Please refer to the [Atlassian Privacy Policy](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy) for more information on how Atlassian handles your data.
